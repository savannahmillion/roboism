## Roboism

This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site that I designed and built to house [Roboism](http://www.roboism.fm/), the podcast that I cohost with [Alex Cox](https://twitter.com/AlexCox).

The audio files are hosed on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/roboismcast). The custom player interface was built mostly by [David Laskey](https://twitter.com/david_laskey).

## Soundcloud Setup

This branch contains the functionality for hosting your podcast through soundcloud. We're switching to simplecast so I'm no longer maintaining this, but I wanted to save it just in case.
