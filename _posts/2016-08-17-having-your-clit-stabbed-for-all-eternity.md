*Here's the story Siri wrote for us:*

>Robots and I have to be the first half of the best thing ever. The fact that you can get the best thing ever is a good one. I'm so excited to see my tweets are about to be able to get the chance to win. The only way to go out with a new song is the best way to get a new phone. I love the fact that you can be a little more than one million people in the world. I just want to see you soon and the other day I will never understand how people are so many things to say that you can be. I'm so tired.
